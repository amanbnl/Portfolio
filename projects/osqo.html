    <h1>Built a Property Management Application (OSQO)</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://depositgaploans.com/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>An OSQO Deposit Gap Loan (DGL) is a financial product that gives you an opportunity to purchase a property more
      cost effectively than using alternatives such as Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI), by funding any savings
      shortfall, or ‘deposit gap’</p>
    <h3> Tech stack</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS - SNS, SQS, DocumentDB, DynamoDB, S3</li>
      <li>Angular and Nestjs</li>
      <li>Event Based Microservice Architecture</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Third party libraries Integration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Box Client - For storing documents.
      </li>
      <li>Loggly - for debugging purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Role and Responsibilities</h3>
    <p> I have spent most of the time in managing and developing backend services. However there were few things that I
      have implemented on frontend side like AuthO. Below were my Responsibilities in this project -</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        writing, testing, and debugging code according to project requirements by following the coding standards.
      </li>
      <li>collaborating with other engineers, designers, and project managers.</li>
      <li> Ensuring the quality and reliability of the feature before delivery by doing proper unit testing.</li>
      <li>documentation of the feature and code, processes, and project-related information</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major difficulties and their resolution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As I was new to AWS. Initially, it was a little difficult for me to adapt to it, But after spending some time
        I got used to it and got familiar with its services.</li>
      <li>How to delete a stack and redeploy from scratch was another difficulty that I have faced. By following proper
        steps of deleting stack and redeployment I have found the solution for it.</li>
      <li>Effective use of cloudWatch service - Initially during debugging sessions I struggle in using cloudwatch, But
        after getting used to it, it has helped me a lot in how we can debug the issue in one go.</li>
      <li>Memory issue while deploying stack - I have solved the memory issue related to stack deployment using shell
        script.</li>
    </ul>
