    <h1>Currently Building an MCQ website.</h1>
    <p>Currently working on an MCQ website through which anyone can train skills in specific subjects.</p>
    <h3>Why ?</h3>
    <p>While I was preparing for interviews, I found that most of the resources are paid through which we can prepare
      interview questions. However there are some free platforms available. So, I decided to build my own small
      application through which anyone can train skills in different subjects.</p>
    <h4> I have used following tech stack in this project -</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>MongoDb</li>
      <li>Angular and ExpressJs</li>
      <li>Repository Architecture pattern.</li>
      <li>cyclic.sh for deployment</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Main difficulties that I have solved while building this project.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> While I was building the backend side of this project. Cyclic.sh had changed their policy (You can only host
        1 website/github account).
        So I have solved that problem by creating nested application and grouped that application into a single one so
        that I can host all of my future projects using single repository.
      </li>
      <li>Another thing was that each application should have their own mongodb cluster so I have solved that issue as
        well.
      </li>
      <li>Planned sprints over JIRA so that I can easily tracked issues/features.
      </li>
    </ul>
